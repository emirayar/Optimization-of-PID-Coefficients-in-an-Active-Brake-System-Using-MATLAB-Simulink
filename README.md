# Optimization of PID Coefficients in an Active Brake System Using MATLAB/Simulink
This study presents PID parameter optimization for an active braking system with two DC motors in Simulink. One motor rotates freely, while the other applies PID-controlled braking. The fminsearchbnd function minimizes velocity error. Simulations show improved performance with optimized PID gains.
